# 5x5gym
Create an app with the same functionalities of 5x5 app, available at AppStore.

I am a newbie.
For sure, I am.

I never have studied programming before, but I believe even getting to 40 years old, I still can learn something, I maybe I can create some interesting apps using my actual expertise with process-engineer.

At this moment, I'm working with swift language, using Xcode. I took some time at last years to understand Java and the principles of objects orientation.

Let' go!
